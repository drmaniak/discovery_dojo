Agentic RAG

Atomic unit of an Agentic RAG graph is the agent.
These agents can vary in complexity, but they are essentially role & task
constrained LLMs with the ability to use tools/functions and have a feedback
mechanism
Unpopular Opinions: An agent is basically a graph (within the larger Graph)
